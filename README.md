# TikZ `graphs` package tutorial

This is a list of examples of how to draw graphs using the `graphs` package in TikZ. Everything in this package can be achieved using only basic `\node` and `\draw` commands, but the `graphs` package automates an incredible amount of this, understanding complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, cycles graphs, paths, node chains, and using complex algorithms to place the vertices in the best positions (most of the time).

This document only makes sense when viewing the source code (`Graphs.tex`) at the same time as the PDF. All explanations are comments in the code.

Here, we will only scratch the surface of what `tikz/graphs` can do. If you want a more intimate knowledge of how to use this and how it works, see the documentation [here](http://ftp.math.purdue.edu/mirrors/ctan.org/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf}).
